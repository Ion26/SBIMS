Project Statement — SBIMS (Student Branch Information Management System)
Problem Statement

Managing student information manually becomes difficult as the number of students increases. Branch-wise student details such as names, IDs, years, GPA, and email are often maintained in scattered files, making retrieval, updates, analytics, and verification slow and error-prone.

To address this, the Student Branch Information Management System (SBIMS) provides a centralized, modular, and user-friendly solution for storing and managing student records efficiently.
